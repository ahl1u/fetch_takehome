**1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?**

I am most familiar with Python for algorithmic problem-solving, which made it an easy choice for this assignment. 
Flask is also lightweight and simple for building standalone APIs which made sense as it made setup and development easy.
Lastly, Postman was good to test the API as the requests were quite simple and hence the ease of use was optimal.

**2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?**

Main benefits:
My solution was quite efficient for processing transactions as I used a deque which allows for constant time when processing transactions for the spend function.
Moreover, using things like defaultdicts made the code very simple. Lastly, Flask is very intuitive to test.

Main disadvantage:
Not very scalable since everything is handled in memory, I'd rather use a database if we intended to store the info of many customers. 

**3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?**

My favorite personal project has been Classmate, a course scheduling tool I made for my fellow students to use. It was the first time I built an application that many people would genuinely be using, and ensuring 
constant uptime was quite difficult.
